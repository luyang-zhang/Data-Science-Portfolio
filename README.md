## [1. Multiple Linear Regression ](https://github.com/luyang-zhang/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/6786f7f8470c3a1a294646ae3020b0c2561f1ce1/1.%20Multiple%20Linear%20Regression.pdf)
- Constructed a multiple linear regression model of beta-carotene
- Conducted exploratory data analysis of univariate and multivariate data, including pie charts, histograms, and boxplots
- Using stepwise model selection to get a reduced model, improved model explanatory power by 3% from the full MLR model 
- performed ANOVA and diagnosed models including hypothesis testing and cross validation
- Pinpointed the top five strongest predictors of beta-carotene levels

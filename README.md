- Constructed a multiple linear regression model of beta-carotene
- Conducted exploratory data analysis of univariate and multivariate data, including pie charts, histograms, and boxplots
- Using stepwise model selection to get a reduced model, improved model explanatory power by 3% from the full MLR model 
- performed ANOVA and diagnosed models including hypothesis testing and cross validation
- Pinpointed the top five strongest predictors of beta-carotene levels

The relationship between beta-carotene levels and several different predictors were analyzed, based on data from 315 patients from an observational study. Body mass index and calorie intake were negatively related to beta-carotene levels. Fiber intake and the consumption of vitamins were positively related to beta-carotene levels. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant interaction between smoking and dietary carotene in determining beta-carotene levels. These results confirm the importance of predictors identified in prior literature, but also propose additional determinants of beta-carotene levels.
